# Tomorrow Insights
This project is a little side project to get a better understanding of the monthly expenses for [Tomorrow](https://www.tomorrow.one/) accounts.

At the time I built this website the **insights** feature is only available to the solo account. But since I use more the together account I was really missing the insights.

I would like that anybody having a Tomorrow account can use this tool, without wondering what happens to their data. All CSV files that are drag & dropped or selected, will only be on your machine. **No data or request will be send to calculate the insights! No analytics!** To ensure that this tool is open source, so everyone can have a look at the code.

If you have feedback you can create an [issue](https://github.com/tmwrnr/tomorrow-insights/issues).

This project is build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
